Dear everyone
	Welcome to join this session, it is my honor to present our project here. I come from DevFins team, my project is to focus on resolving invoice verification and vendor payment process for SCB Accounting operation department.
	Our users are from AO department. The big problem what they are facing is so heave manual operation, communicate with vendor, no unique e-form template and risk of manual mistake.
	So far AO staff receives paper invoice from vendor who needs to reimburse, AO staff will manually input invoice information  into system and verify its correctness. AO staff needs to reject ineffective invoice request and communicate to related stakeholder by 
email / tel. For effective invoice, AO staff will copy invoice manually and start to next payment process. During the whole process, AO staff is working manually within low efficiency and always facing risk of manual mistake and information of isolation.
	In our new design, we will provide a new payment platform to resolve these problems. Our target is to make everything automatically,  improve efficiency and reduce manual risk to Zero.
	In China, each invoice has an unique QR code and it saves all of this invoice information. We will provide a hardware to scan invoice information and then the information will be input into system automatically.
	In future, the requestor will use website or mobile app to submit reimbursement within the electronic invoice. AO staff can use this scanner to scan this invoice QR Code instead of manual typing, and then the invoice information will auto-import into our system. The system will auto-match with China Tax Golden Source to do invoice verification. Whatever the invoice is effective or not, the system will trigger email automatically to stakeholder.
	After apply this new system, we can
	1. Improve 25 multiple efficiency. AO staff needs 25 seconds to input and verify an invoice at least. After using scanner, it will take less than 1 second to complete all processes.
	2. Reduce manual risk to Zero. After applying this system, there is no manual operation at all, so we can say that's 100% safe.
	3. Digital and eco-office. There is no paper request in new system, every data is changed to electronic form and save into database. So we can save paper cost, print cost as well as time cost.
	4. Audit automation. Everything is saving in database, so we can search and check history invoice easily for end of year audit. If it is still paper invoice, it will be a huge job to look for one invoice from thousands of invoices.
	That's all for our project brief. please remember our team name DevFins. It is Development plus Finance. Our team target is to make Financial operation Simpler, Faster and Better.
